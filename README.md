## System Architecture

The CarSellHubAPI follows a layered architecture pattern to maintain separation of concerns and improve maintainability:

- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- Services: Contain business logic for features like car management, advertisements, and reviews
- Models: Represent the application's data structures
- Repositories: Abstract data access logic
- Middleware: Handle request filtering and authentication
